Making Topographic Maps with Python.


![Map_GIF](../../../../images/map_gif_cropped.gif)

I was inspired by this <a href = "https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/ch26di/cycling_route_plotted_on_realistic_3d_map_oc/">post</a> to make something similar using Python. Below is the code and data sources that I used to make my own version. 


```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import geopandas as gpd
%matplotlib notebook
```
