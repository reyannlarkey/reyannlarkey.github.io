# An Examination of Prompt and Delayed Lightning Sferics Associated with TGFs

We provide an analysis of the prompt and delayed radio atmospheric signals (“sferics”) associated with a subset of TGFs. Data from Fermi GBM detected TGFs along with lightning location data from the World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN) and the Earth Networks Total Lightning Network (ENTLN) are used to examine the properties of lightning flashes and TGFs that produce both “prompt” sferics (less than 10ms time difference) in relation to the TGF as well as “delayed” sferics (300-500ms time difference). Further information regarding the sferic radio low-frequency signals is provided by Duke university sensors. 


### Characteristics of the sferics and TGFs are listed below
