I am currently a Graduate Student at Montana State Univerisity. Right now I'm studying Terrestrial Gamma-Ray Flashes (TGFs) and their associated lightning. I'll add more details later but for now I'm just testing stuff with this website. 

## Current Projects
<div style="text-align:center">
<img src="../images/TGF.png" border="1" style="width: 500px;"/>
</div>
This is the TGF image that's always used so I *have* to put it here.
