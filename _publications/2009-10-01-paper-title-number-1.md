excerpt: 'Terrestrial Gamma-Ray flashes (TGFs) are intense bursts of high energy radiation that are associated with some lightning flashes. We examined a sample of thunderstorms that produced these TGFs and compared the times between all different lightning flashes within those individual storms. We found that the time between the TGF-producing flash and the flash immediately prior to it was typically longer than normal, implying that the electric field had more time to charge up. Conversely, we found that the time between the TGF-producing flash and the flash immediately afterwards was typically about the same length as other flash intervals in the same storms, implying that the TGF returned the cloud to a "normal" state. We found that these results were highly unlikely to have occurred by chance.'
